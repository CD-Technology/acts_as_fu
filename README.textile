h1. ACTS_AS-FU

Now you have no excuse for not test-driving your ActiveRecord
extending plugins.

h3. Usage

In your spec_helper.rb or test_helper.rb

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'acts_as_fu'
  require 'spec'
  
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include ActsAsFu
  end

Then in your specs/tests:

  describe "acts_as_gilmore_girls" do
    include ActsAsFu # YOU GOTTA DO THIS PART
  
    before(:each) do
      build_model :nerds do
        text :omg_omg_bio
        string :name
        string :favorite_scene
      end
    end
    
    it "should require favorite scene" do
      nerd = Nerd.new :favorite_scene => nil
      nerd.should_not be_valid
      nerd.errors.on(:favorite_scene).should_not be_nil
    end
    
    it "has other stuff" do
      # ETC!
    end
  end
  
The @build_model@ method allows you to build an ActiveRecord on
the fly. It takes a block where you can specify columns. The table
will be created in in an in-memory sqlite3 database. If you need
another adapter, this project ain't for you. Sorry.

h3. Installation

Since I'm not so bright, I can't figure out how to generate a gemspec
without using one of those darnfangled, gargantuan tools like hoe or
newgem. As a result, you'll need to use the gemify gem to install:

  gemify -I

If anybody knows an easier way to do the gemspec, please do share.  

TODO

* Maybe a couple more options... maybe.
* A real gemspec
